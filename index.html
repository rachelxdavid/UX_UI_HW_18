     <h3>User Research</h3>
      <p>I employ a diverse range of research methods, from the creation of empathy maps to user interviews, with the goal of unearthing valuable insights that drive the design process. Ensuring that the end product truly addresses the user's needs and pain points.</p>

      <h3>User Empathy</h3>
      <p>I actively seek to understand and connect with users on a personal level, allowing their experiences and emotions to inform every design decision I make, ultimately creating interfaces that resonate deeply and deliver a seamless user journey.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="skillThree">
      <img src="Images/interview.jpg">
      <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>
      <p>When interviewing, I create a space that encourage users to share their authentic thoughts, emotions, and experiences. This allows me to gain insights into their needs and preferences, which in turn, informs design decisions that prioritize their satisfaction and usability.</p>
